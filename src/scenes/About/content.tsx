export const WELCOME_MESSAGE = `Hi there, first of all, thank you so much for downloading my app!
The HueTV app was made for those who want to dim the living room lights just before start watching 
their favorite TV show and are too lazy to unlock their phone and open the (sometimes slow) 
lights app, or for those who just want to show off that they can control all the 
lights in their house using the TV remote.`;

export const ABOUT_TITLE = `The name is Carlos`;
export const ABOUT_ME = `I'm Carlos Zinato, software engineer living in The Netherlands and like 
every developer I have started 196 side projects on the last four months and this is the one that 
finally sees the light of day. I've been working as a software engineer for 12 years now, making 
mobile apps for iOS and Android and a little of web with ReactJS for the past three years.
If you like this app and it makes you happy please consider buying me a coffee. It will definitely 
motivate me to keep it up-to-date and adding more features!`;

export const MOTIVATION_TITLE = `Motivation`;
export const MOTIVATION1 = `Like mentioned above I was just curious to see if I could dim the 
lights in my apartment, just before pressing play in a movie or show from my recently bought 
Samsung TV and for my surprise there was no app available on the Samsung store. As a developer 
I decided to give it a try and see how difficult it would be to create and run a TV app by myself 
and after a couple of hours downloading SDKs and Simulators another side project was kicked off.
`;

export const MOTIVATION2 = `This means that it'll be forever free and there's no reason 
for it to collect analytics or any other private information from your TV, lights or 
house, in fact this app doesn't even connect to the internet, everything happens 
inside your private Wi-Fi network!`;

export const MOTIVATION3 = `I hope it becomes useful and fun to use for you as it became for me.`;

export const OPEN_SOURCE_TITLE = `Open source`;
export const OPEN_SOURCE = `For those interested in how you can build and deploy an app 
to the Samsung TV and control your Philips Hue lights using JavaScript and ReactJS this 
project is available on GitHub as open source. There you can clone the project, 
learn how to run it locally, ask questions, give some feedback, 
open issues and of course - contribute!`;
